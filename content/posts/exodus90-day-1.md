# Exodus90: Day 1

Some young men in my community and I have decided to embark on [Exodus90](https://exodus90.com/) together. I've decided to daily blog it, thus jumpstarting my blog.

The most basic and important part of Exodus90 or any other program like this is "Find your why". My "why" is simple: to be a better husband for my wife and a better man for my community.

All in all today went smoothly, some technical issues and decisions aside (which meant that my "unnecessary" screen time wasn't at an absolute minimum). Reassurringly I even felt one or two pangs of boredom, which are often completely absent in **These Times**â„¢. The daily Holy Hour felt long, but a good kind of long, and my daily Rosary was especially fruitful.

Tomorrow is a different beast; I absolutely need to get the most of my sleep tonight since I'll be contending with my work schedule and community activities, along with adding exercise to the regimen.

Please pray for me.

Pax vobiscum.
